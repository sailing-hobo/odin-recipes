        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Warm cornflakes with a caramelised layer of sugar on top. Perfect for students craving something sweet, or any individuals who need a comfort snack with a hint of childhood memories sprinkled in.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cornflakes, as much as your little heart desires</li>
            <li>Milk, just enough to cover the amount of cornflakes you chose</li>
            <li>Sugar. I would tell you to behave, but what the hell. Put as much sugar as you can. Less sugar than the weight of cornflakes is advised however.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put cornflakes in microwaveable bowl</li>
            <li>Put milk until it is <em>just</em> less than the cornflakes</li>
            <li>Murder with sugar</li>
            <li>Microwave for 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Eat and brace for sugar rush</li>
        </ol>
